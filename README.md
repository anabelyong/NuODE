# NuODE
Numerical Ordinary Differential Equations and Applications
1) determine appropriate numerical methods to solve a range of ODEs.
2) implement such numerical methods in a suitable programming language.
3) derive and analyse such methods and their errors.
4) understand the principles of consistency, stability and convergence.
5) apply the above to examples from modern applied mathematics.
